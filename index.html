									<h2 class="major">Expectation 1: Spanish Text</h2>
                                    <p>I expected to see more Native American traditional art as many spanish speaking countries were inhabited by indigenous populations before the conquest of the Spanish. I also expected somewhat of a Hispanic American experience due to the modernization of her name, and use of language. 
Sugar Sweet: Knowing the title, and understand the imagery of Sugar, I expected the art to utilize a sweet characteristic to the work, utilizing more vibrant color and patterns. The image that also popped into my mind was white pure sugar, and the fine grain delicacy of it. 
Modernistic: Not knowing the age of the artist or her complete background, I expected the art to have some modernist elements of simplicity and use of clean plain spaces.

									<h2 class="major">Experience 1: Quote</h2>
									<p> One the experience I really enjoyed was the writing of the quote both in English and Spanish on walls, which really connects all the elements of the exhibit. Creating a theme of bittersweet, explaining the feeling of sorrow and remorse the artist is trying to convey. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Experience 2: Photography</h2>

									<h2 class="major">Experience 3: Statues of Spears with the Sugar</h2>
									<p> Statues of Spears with the Sugar: Another awe moment I experience, was the visual experience of seeing standing ancient spears with burnt sugar blocks with different shades of brown surrounding it. It portrayed the complex relationship of indigenous culture and the sugar slave trade, inferencing the destruction of culture. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Discovery 1: Artist Race</h2>
                                    <p>One shocking discovery, was the race of the artist, I expected her to be of  mestizo Cuban background  but surprisingly and uniquely she came from African decent. Unknowing of the Afro-Cuban community, I expected the artist to depict the background of European based cuban, not the Afro-Latinos of the island.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Discovery 2: Symbolism of Sugar</h2>
                                    <p>After my experience in the gallery, I had a new and complex relationship with sugar, than before. I know look at sugar and imagine the pain and suffering slaves went to produce the pure white substance, often neglecting the corrosive, destructive inpurities that were thrust upon the slaves. Sugar for some might be sweet, but sugar for the artist has a bitter after taste of regret, pain and misery. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Connection 1: Intersectionality</h2>
									<p>One major connection I made is restructuring my own meaning of Latinidad, or the shared attribute that make up the Latinx community. I made my think about my own basis and closed minded perspective that a Latino can only lock or be from a certain place.  This exhibit reminded me that Latinidad encopases many indenities, meaing it will never have a homogeneous, concrete definition, it will forever by dynamic and ever changing.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Connection 2: Spanish to Convey Meaning</h2>
									<p> Finally another connections that I made with my identity was the use of language and bilingualism to convey different feelings for individuals. The use of Spanish text did create an inclusive environment, but it also paid homage to the culture and people of the island, as the quotes had a deeper meaning to individuals that the misinterpreted words in Spanish. I learned that knowing Spanish create and develop a deeper connections between culture and communities. </p>
