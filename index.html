									<h2 class="major">Expectation 1: Spanish Text</h2>
                                    <p>I expected to see more Native American traditional art as many spanish speaking countries were inhabited by indigenous populations before the conquest of the Spanish. I also expected somewhat of a Hispanic American experience due to the modernization of her name, and use of language. 
Sugar Sweet: Knowing the title, and understand the imagery of Sugar, I expected the art to utilize a sweet characteristic to the work, utilizing more vibrant color and patterns. The image that also popped into my mind was white pure sugar, and the fine grain delicacy of it. 
Modernistic: Not knowing the age of the artist or her complete background, I expected the art to have some modernist elements of simplicity and use of clean plain spaces.

									<h2 class="major">Experience 1: Quote</h2>
									<p> One the experience I really enjoyed was the writing of the quote both in English and Spanish on walls, which really connects all the elements of the exhibit. Creating a theme of bittersweet, explaining the feeling of sorrow and remorse the artist is trying to convey. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Experience 2: Photography</h2>
									<p> The photography gave me a surreal moment as it provided a human perspective to the art, by the artist using burnt sugar to coat trap and engulf individuals gave a new meaning to the impact sugar had on lives. </p>

									<h2 class="major">Experience 3: Statues of Spears with the Sugar</h2>
									<p> Statues of Spears with the Sugar: Another awe moment I experience, was the visual experience of seeing standing ancient spears with burnt sugar blocks with different shades of brown surrounding it. It portrayed the complex relationship of indigenous culture and the sugar slave trade, inferencing the destruction of culture. </p>
